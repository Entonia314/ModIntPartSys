# ModIntPartSys
Project for the course 'Modelling interacting particle systems in science'. 
Implemented model for 3-body problem and five numerical methods to solve it in python. 
With Plotly's Dash, the results are shown on a dashboard - visit dashboard on alton.pythonanywhere.com.

While all the code is written by myself (except of dash_reusable_components.py,
which is only for layout) there was theoretical input from the course "Numerical Methods for Differential Equations" 
and my teammates of that course: Leo, Daniel and Stefan.
